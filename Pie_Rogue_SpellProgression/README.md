# Rogue Spell Progression

This mod **OVERRIDES** the vanilla spell progression for Arcane Trickster and adds 5e spells into the selection from spell level 3 onwards (as those lists are not defined by 5e spells)

As such, it **requires** 5e spells and is very likely **incompatible** with all other mods that edit vanilla Arcane Trickster
