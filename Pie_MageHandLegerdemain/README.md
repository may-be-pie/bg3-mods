# Mage Hand Legerdemain Changes

Since Mage Hand Legerdemain currently doesn't really do anything, this mod adds a few buffs to Magehand:
- adds a self-invisibility cantrip to Mage Hand
- adds a knock cantrip to Magehand

The Knock might be a bit overpowered in that it makes both Thieves' Tools and the regular Knock spell almost entirely useless in a party with an Arcane Trickster

## Future Goals
- modify Mage Hand Cooldown to no longer require a short rest
- make Mage Hand able to Lockpick and Disarm traps (as promised in its vanilla tooltip)
- make Mage Hand able to Pickpocket and maybe even Disarm targets
