# Shadow Sorcery

A subclass for Sorcerer.
Inspired by Baaleos' Shadow Sorcerer - Subclass mod: [https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/923](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/923)
However, this is a different take on and implementation of the subclass. 

## Requirements
Celes' 5e spells: [https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/125](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/125)
Some spells are added as Origin Spells for this subclass, so trying to use this mod without 5e spells will likely lead to crashes.

## Compatibility
To use this mod with other subclass mods, you'll need the Compatibility Framework: [https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/1933](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/1933)
There shouldn't be any conflicts with other mods. 

## Features

### Origin Spells
The biggest departure from tabletop version of this subclass.

| Level | Spells                         |
|:-----:| ------------------------------ |
| 1     | Arms of Hadar, Bane |
| 3     | Blindness, Darkness  |
| 5     | Fear, Spirit Shroud   |
| 7     | Evard's Black Tentacles, Beckoning Darkness |
| 9     | Negative Energy Flood |

**Beckoning Darkness** is a BG3 specific spell that's normally exclusive to NPCs and items.

### Level 1
#### Eyes of the Dark
Gain Darkvision with a range of 120ft.

#### Strength of the Grave
Instead of being downed, you drop to 1 HP, unless you took Radiant damage or damage from a Critical Hit. This feature can only be used once per long rest.

### Level 3
#### Eyes of the Dark
Gain the spell **Sorcerous Darkness**, a variant of Darkness that costs Sorcery Points instead of a spell slot and grants the caster the ability to see through magical Darkness while the spell is up. 

### Level 6
#### Hound of Ill Omen
You gain the spell **Hound of Ill Omen: Mark Target**. Once you've used this spell, you unlock the spell **Hound of Ill Omen: Summon Hound**. Marking a target counts as a hostile action, but doesn't do anything on its own.

The hound, once summoned, stays for up to 50 turns (5 minutes). Its presence prevents the marked target from hiding or turning invisible and, if the hound is within 5ft of the target, the target has disadvantage on all saving throws against the summoning sorcerer's spells.

The hound can only attack the marked target, but once the target is reduced to 0 HP, a new target can be marked.

#### Shadow Curse Immunity
You're immune to the Shadow Curse. 

### Level 11
#### Shadow Walk
You gain the ability to use a bonus action to teleport between lightly or heavily obscured areas. Needs line of sight.

## Known Issues
There's no jumping or hiding animations for the Hound of Ill Omen. I might fix that eventually, but for now it's still really funny to me as is.
