# Sorcerer Origin Spells

## Dependencies

This mod requires the [Community Library](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/1333), the [Compatibility Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/1933) and [Celes' 5e spells](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/125) to be installed!

- 5e spells contains some of the spells added
- the Compatibility Framework is used to actually add the spells and to preserve compatibility with other mods
- the Community Library is used for progression nodes that don't exist within the vanilla game files

## Draconic Bloodline Origin Spells

All Bloodlines keep the spell granted to them by default, spells listed here are an addition, not a replacement. 

**Known Issue**: 
- only the spells common to all Draconic Ancestries are shown on level up, but all spells listed below are added
- it's possible to learn some spells that was added via this mod on levelup, so for example a sorcerer with Red Draconic Ancestry could learn Scorching Ray twice
